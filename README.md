# Teckrowes

Hello guys! in order to run the project you'll have to do 2 things:  
1 - npm install  
2 - npm run start  
  
In order to run the tests:  
npm run test  

1 - Using an Angular framework, create a login page for Teckro which is mobile responsive. The designs of the page are attached.  
2 - Use best guess on colours, padding, sizing etc.  
3 - There should be email validation to make sure a valid email is used.  
4 - The password should be validated to be  8 characters or longer, 1 special character, 1 number, 1 uppercase character, 1 lower case character  
5 - Clicking login check the validation before submitting the form  
6 - An error should be shown on the page if either field does not pass validation  
7 - The text box should turn red when it fails  
8 - Changing the value in the textbox should remove red when the value is made valid (before hitting submit)  
9 - The form should submit to a dummy server.
